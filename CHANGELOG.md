#### Breaking Changes
- Rename the image from `thelounge/lounge` to [`thelounge/thelounge`](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelounge/thelounge/) on DockerHub.
- Drop from root user in the container.
    - This may affect file permissions on the *host system* of mounted data directories. To resolve this, refer to running as a custom user in the [README](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker/blob/3.0.0/README.md).
    - These file permission errors are restricted to the host system only, The Lounge will continue to run successfully in the container.
- Change default data path from `/home/lounge/data` to `/var/opt/thelounge`.
    - This requires you to update your mounted data volume to mount at `/var/opt/thelounge`.
- Remove support for the `HOST`, `PORT` and `BIND` environment variables.
    - You can instead set these config options in the config file, or by running the container with a custom command where you supply the configurations.
- Remove the `slim` flavour.
- No longer installs `vim` and `nano` in the base image.
